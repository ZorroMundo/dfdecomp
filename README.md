This is a tool for helping data-mine and mod the fan-game "DON'T FORGET", on it's latest version (v2.7.7 as of now).

This tool is still on very heavy W.I.P, and some things may not even work at all.

As of now I'm aware loading the data.win on UTMT will throw errors, that's because I messed up serializing :/
